<h1>Natural Language Data Visualization with LLM</h1>
You can easily upload dataset, then ask the llm to generate a chart from the data.

Using Google's Gemini API as our LLM (gemini-1.5-flash), we can promt what chart we want to create with any specific aggregations using natural language. The output will be the code generated and the output result.
